  The International Astronomical Union has announced that extrasolar planets
  might get more interesting names. This is making one planet, Gliese 581d, a
  bit angsty. It really wants a nice mythical name like the Solar System
  planets and not to be named after celebrities or you mum or your cat
  (Colin).
