## SAAO - Cape Town, South Africa

Astronomy is driven forward by new technology, and today, software is developing more rapidly than it ever has.   How can new technologies help astronomical research, education, and outreach?   How can new developments in machine learning, web interfaces, and software impact our work?  How can new ideas and techniques in education and research increase our productivity?  How can we leverage our diversity to better understand the Universe?

The .Astronomy conference brings together people in astronomy, technology, and education to build on our strengths for a better community.  The rapid growth in astronomy in South Africa with projects like SKA, SALT, and Office of Astronomy for Development makes it an exciting time to look at advances in new technologies along with a vibrant, growing community.

dotAstro 9 is a three+one day event with ~57 participants.
