description: >
  Exploring multiwavelength astronomy with sound. Each waveband has a pitch,
  the intensity/brightness in that waveband is represented by volume/loudness
  of the note. When you scan a mouse of an image Chromotone plays a chord
  with different components which correspond to the intensity at each pixel
  superposed. The original version was written in Processing which is not
  particularly web friendly so this project aims to make a version which is
  lighter, more efficient and has added functionality.
