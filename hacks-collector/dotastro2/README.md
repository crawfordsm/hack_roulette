# .Astronomy 2

## November 30 – Dec 4, 2009

## Venue: Lorentz Centre, Leiden

**Local Organisers:** Sarah Kendrew, Carolina Ödman.

.Astronomy 2 was held in the excellent Lorentz Centre, part of the University of Leiden. It was the event where we first held Unconference sessions and a Hack Day. Both were very popular during this five-day marathon meeting. The Lorentz Centre’s offices-and-desks setup, and bicycles were a big hit with attendees.
