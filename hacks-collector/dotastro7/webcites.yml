  This hack takes an ADS bibliographic code and plots a geographical web of
  citations for that paper. It finds the institutions of the first authors of
  papers which cite the given paper. You can also toggle to show the web for
  all the authors on the papers which cite the given paper. It uses leaflet
  to display the map data.
