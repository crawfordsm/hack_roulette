# Using Hack Collector for non dotAstronomy events

You are welcome to use this Hack Collector for non dotAstronomy
meetings. Here is a possibly non-complete list of things you may need or
want to change.

First of all, you will need a copy of this repo. If you would like to have the submission app running as well, you may want to have a copy of https://github.com/dotastro/hack-list-submission-app as well.

## Change all dotastro related namings.

Delete all the "dotasto*" directories containing previous dotAstronomy hack
entries. Create directories for your meetings instead, including a REAMDE.md
in each of them.

If you plan to have the submission app, you need to do the same excercise in the copy of the hack-list-submission-app repo as well.
