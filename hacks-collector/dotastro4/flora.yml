  Flora is an attempt to enable quantitative measurements on images in a
  browser. In astronomy, we want to measure the position, size and brightness
  of various objects in our images - which in practice means fitting a model
  to them. Flora uses Javascript and canvas to allow the user to point at an
  object they want to measure, and have a catalog entry of measurements
  returned. We use the astrojs library to handle FITS images (including
  calibration information in the header) and the transformations needed to
  turn pixel positions into "world" coordinates on the sky.
